# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Generate A Strong Password (GASP)

GASP is a very simple to use password generator. I can create a passwprd for you between 8 - 128 characters using any combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## But how do I use it?

Simply click the "Generate Password" button. You will receive a series of prompts asking you what you want your password to include and how long it needs to be.

Once I generate a password for you, you can keep clicking the "Generate Password" button, and I will generate more passwords for you until you're satisfied.

To reset the page, simply refresh by pressing F5 on your keyboard.

## What does this magical app look like?
